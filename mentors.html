					<h1>Adam "Lightning" McQueen</h1>
					<p>Our fearless mentor Mr. McQueen brings absolutely zero coding experience, but his willingness to learn, and ability to pass on that drive is what makes him great. Mr. McQueen has been teaching robotics at lincoln for 4 years now, all of them in FTC. McQueen enjoys cracking dad jokes and being a tool sometimes, especially regarding David’s grades, but it's ok he's worth having around. McQueen is an insightful person overall, knowing what is realistic and what isn't regarding building ideas and most things related to robotics. Mr. McQueen’s special skill is setting rigorous deadlines and hounding us to accomplish them, while kicking back in his reclinable office chair eating his lunch. We wouldn't trade anyone in the world for Mr. McQueen, no matter how lazy he always is. All in all, Mr. McQueen is an amazing mentor who always tries his best to provide and give us the tools to succeed.</p>

					<h1>Richard Tinling</h1>
					<p>Arguably the most wise and Gandalf looking member of Team Mentor, Mr. Tinling is a mathematically inclined mentor who looks to bring his knowledge of coding and math to the team. He has assisted the coding team when stuck, and lightened morale during frustrating times. Mr. Tinling started the FTC program at Lincoln because he wanted to give the opportunity to join FIRST to those who didn't have it before.</p>
