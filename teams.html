							<p>A new team for the 2017-18 season, NT-1 had no experience, but big dreams and lot of confidence. 
							“We’re the coolest kids on the block” says team cheerleader and engineering connoisseur Elias Raider. 
							Although they were not as successful in competition as they hoped, in their failure they have found personal victory.

							<p>Team Meme Machine is considered to be Lincoln High School’s “veteran” team, due to its members having lots of previous FTC experience. It is the culmination of 4 previous teams and 5 seasons of FTC. 
							This results in high expectations, which were not necessarily fulfilled this season.
